# iFox
A set of tools for Microsoft Visual FoxPro implementing the most common internet protocols.


This project started as a freeware library in the now gone ifox.com.ar site around 1999 to demonstrate what can be done in Microsoft Visual FoxPro.
As years passes by it evolved as a complete solution, covering a broad range of protocols.

As Pablo Pioli, the original developer, moved to other horizons the source code went public with a LGPL license.

It's important to remark that the project will not receive significant additions but pull requests will be accepted. Includes a (mostly) updated documentation.
